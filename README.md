# Overview
This repository contains all the code needed to complete the final project for the Localization course in Udacity's Self-Driving Car Nanodegree. I implemented a particle filter by following the instruction provided during the course. My implementation meet the requirements since the output says "Success! Your particle filter passed!" then it means Iâ€™ve met the requirements.

## Project Introduction
Your robot has been kidnapped and transported to a new location! Luckily it has a map of this location, a (noisy) GPS estimate of its initial location, and lots of (noisy) sensor and control data.

## Success Criteria
My implementation passes the current grading code in the simulator. The things the grading code is looking for are:

1. **Accuracy**: my particle filter localizes vehicle position and yaw to within the values specified in the parameters `max_translation_error` and `max_yaw_error` in `src/main.cpp`.

2. **Performance**: my particle filter completes execution within the time of 100 seconds.

## Running the Code
I used docker setup the environment. You can run ./run_term2_docker.sh to use the doker environment. Once run_term2_docker.sh is executed, the main program can be built and ran by doing the following from the /src directory.

1. mkdir build
2. cd build
3. cmake ..
4. make
5. ./particle_filter

# Implementing the Particle Filter
I followed the instructions provided in the course to implement the filter.

## Inputs to the Particle Filter
You can find the inputs to the particle filter in the `data` directory. 

#### The Map*
`map_data.txt` includes the position of landmarks (in meters) on an arbitrary Cartesian coordinate system. Each row has three columns
1. x position
2. y position
3. landmark id

### All other data the simulator provides, such as observations and controls.

> * Map data provided by 3D Mapping Solutions GmbH.

## Discussion

1. My algorithm follows the general processing flow as taught in the lessons and I was able to get the required performance. I encountered 2 issues during the implementation.
    * The first issue was regarding the the situations when yaw_rat was 0. I addressed the issue in the vehicle model that I use in prediction phase.
    * The second issue was in resampling function. A bug in my implementation prevented sampling from the best particles. After addressing the issue, the algorithm woks as expected.
